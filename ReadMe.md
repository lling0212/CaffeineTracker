<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This app is a personal project built for learning purposes (and for fun!). It is not published on App Store. It also has some potential further enhancements underway. However, if you'd like to play with it on the XCode simulator locally, here is how you might be able to do that!


1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lling0212/CaffeineTracker.git
   ```

2. Follow the Firebase iOS setup guide to set up your own backend database - [https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)

3. Enable Firebase Authentication, Storage and Firestore Database to allow for the full back-end functionality of the app

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments

I built this app from scratch with no prior experience with iOS development. Thankfully I was able to rely on some amazing resources to build out both the front end UI and backend functionalities I envisioned. Here is a list of resources that helped tremendously on my development journey: 

* To learn about Firebase and how to set up the basic structure of my app, I took inspiration from [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/t_mypMqSXNw?si=b7Y9zPLR9Mm91Sq1)
* To build the progress ring on the summary dashboard, I referenced [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@frankjia/creating-activity-rings-in-swiftui-11ef7d336676#:~:text=To%20support%20percentages%20over%20100,over%20the%20last%20360%20degrees.)
* To create many of the visual elements (e.g., menu bar), I learned from videos on [this Youtube channel]("https://www.youtube.com/@Kavsoft")
* To build the customized calendar, I referenced [this video](https://youtu.be/pOSQr7DI310?si=DLFOEwOJdXCVhNGN)
* To set up the correct navigation between views, I learned from [this Medium article](https://moussahellal.medium.com/navigation-in-swiftui-custom-and-complete-with-navigationstack-a12f8e8f8745)
