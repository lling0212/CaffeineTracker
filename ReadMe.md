<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This app is a personal project built for learning purposes (and for fun!). It is not published on App Store. It also has some potential further enhancements underway. However, if you'd like to play with it on the XCode simulator locally, here is how you might be able to do that!


1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lling0212/CaffeineTracker.git
   ```

2. Follow the Firebase iOS setup guide to set up your own backend database - [https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)

3. Enable Firebase Authentication, Storage and Firestore Database to allow for the full back-end functionality of the app

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments

I built this app from scratch with no prior experience with iOS development. Thankfully I was able to rely on some amazing resources to build out both the front end UI and backend functionalities I envisioned. Here is a list of resources that helped tremendously on my development journey - 

* Firebase to do list tutorial
* Progress bar
* Front-end UI elements
* Customized calendar 
* Navigation logic
